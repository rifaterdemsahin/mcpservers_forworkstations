# ðŸ“§ Email Server Setup and Usage Guide

This guide provides steps to set up an MCP server with email capabilities and integrate it with OpenAI features.

## Step 1: Choose an Email Sending Library

Pick a library appropriate for your programming environment. For Python, consider:
- `smtplib` for built-in support
- Libraries like `email` for more complex operations

---

## Step 2: Email Server Configuration

1. **Choose a mail service**: Gmail, SendGrid, or similar.
2. **Set up SMTP credentials**: Ensure your application can authenticate and send emails securely.

Example for Gmail with Python's `smtplib`:

```python
import smtplib
from email.message import EmailMessage

def send_email(subject, content):
    # ... existing setup ...

    msg = EmailMessage()
    msg.set_content(content)
    msg['Subject'] = subject
    msg['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
    msg['To'] = 'recipient-email@example.com'

    with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as smtp:
        smtp.login('your-email@gmail.com', 'your-password')
        smtp.send_message(msg)

Step 3: Client Email Sending Strategy
Implement your client to handle continuous operations:

Ensure robust error handling for network issues.
Consider rate limiting if sending large volumes of emails.
Step 4: OpenAI Integration
Leverage OpenAI in processing or generating email content:

Use API calls to OpenAI to augment email generation scripts.
Authenticate and manage responses within your client.
Additional Tips
Regularly update your email libraries for security.
Follow best practices for email content to avoid spam filters.
ðŸ“¬ Monitor and log sent emails for compliance and debugging.
ðŸŒŸ Happy emailing with MCP Server and OpenAI integration!
