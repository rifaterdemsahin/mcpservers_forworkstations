I can help you set up and use MCPServer with VS Code! MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers allow you to extend AI assistants with additional capabilities.
Here's how to get started:
Setting up MCP Server with VS Code
1. Install the Claude for VS Code Extension

Open VS Code
Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
Search for "Claude for VS Code" by Anthropic
Install the extension

2. Configure MCP Servers
Create a configuration file to define your MCP servers. You'll typically need:
json{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/your/project"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git", "--repository", "/path/to/repo"]
    }
  }
}
3. Common MCP Servers

Filesystem Server: Provides file system access
Git Server: Git repository integration
Database Server: Database connectivity
Web Server: Web scraping capabilities
Terminal Server: Command line access

4. Basic Usage
Once configured, you can:

Ask Claude to read/write files through the filesystem server
Query Git history and branches
Execute database queries
Run terminal commands

Example Commands
"Read the contents of src/main.py"
"Show me the git log for the last 5 commits"
"Create a new file called config.json with basic settings"
Would you like me to help you set up a specific MCP server or configure it for a particular use case? What kind of project are you working on?RetryESebd enail witg mcpserverEditI can help you set up email functionality with an MCP server! Here are the main approaches:

const { Server } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const server = new Server({
  name: "email-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Configure transporter
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'gmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
  }
});

server.setRequestHandler('tools/call', async (request) => {
  if (request.params.name === 'send_email') {
    const { to, subject, body } = request.params.arguments;
    
    await transporter.sendMail({
      from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
      to: to,
      subject: subject,
      text: body
    });
    
    return { success: true };
  }
});
Usage Examples
Once configured, you can use commands like:
"Send an email to john@example.com with subject 'Meeting Tomorrow' and body 'Hi John, don't forget our meeting at 2pm tomorrow.'"

"Draft an email to the team about the project update"

"Send a follow-up email to the client with the proposal attached"

✅ Check if app-specific passwords are required
✅ Verify account has SMTP access enabled

🐛 Server Not Starting

✅ Check Node.js is installed (node --version)
✅ Verify all dependencies installed (npm install)
✅ Check file paths in mcp-config.json

🎉 Success!
Once configured, you'll see:

✅ MCP server connects successfully
📧 Emails send through your Titan Email account
🔄 Real-time email sending from VS Code via Claude

Your Titan Email MCP server is now ready to send emails directly from VS Code! 🚀📧RetryEWhy do i careEditYou're right to question that! Here are the practical reasons why you might actually want this setup:
🤔 Real Benefits
⚡ Speed & Automation

Send emails instantly without switching apps
Automate repetitive email tasks while coding
Generate and send reports directly from your workspace

🔧 Developer Workflow

Send error logs or bug reports to team members
Email clients directly from project context
Share code snippets or project updates seamlessly

💼 Business Use Cases

Invoice clients automatically
Send project status updates
Share deliverables without leaving VS Code

🤷‍♂️ But honestly...
If you're just sending occasional emails, you probably don't need this. Regular email clients work fine for most people.
This setup is mainly useful if you:

Send lots of automated/templated emails
Want to integrate email into coding workflows
Need to send emails based on code execution or data
Hate context switching between apps

What were you hoping to accomplish with email + MCP? That might help determine if this approach is actually worth your time or if there's a simpler solution.RetryESo mcpserver runs on my local ?EditYes, exactly! 🏠 MCP servers run locally on your machine.
🖥️ How It Works
Local Process:

MCP server = Node.js process running on your computer
VS Code connects to it via local communication
Your emails send through your internet connection to Titan's servers

🔄 The Flow
VS Code → Local MCP Server → Internet → Titan Email Servers → Recipient
  ↑           ↑                ↑            ↑
Your PC    Your PC        Your ISP    Titan's Servers
🏃‍♂️ Server Lifecycle

Starts: When VS Code loads or when you manually run it
Runs: Continuously in background while VS Code is open
Stops: When you close VS Code or kill the process

💻 Resource Usage

CPU: Minimal (only when sending emails)
RAM: ~10-50MB typically
Network: Only when actually sending emails

🔒 Security Benefits

Your email credentials stay on your machine
No third-party services handling your passwords
Direct connection to Titan's servers

🤔 Alternatives
If you don't want local servers running:

Use Titan's web interface
Use a regular email client
Use VS Code extensions that don't need MCP servers

Think of it like running a small web server just for your email tasks - it's there when you need it, quiet when you don't.
Does running something locally concern you, or were you just clarifying how it works?RetryEHow many mcp servers can i haveEdit🚀 No Hard Limit!
You can run as many MCP servers as you want - it's mainly limited by your system resources and practicality.

🗄️ Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
☁️ Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
🔧 APIs (GitHub, Slack, Notion, Asana)
🖥️ System tools (Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring)

💻 Resource Considerations
Per Server:

💾 RAM: ~10-50MB each
⚡ CPU: Minimal when idle
🌐 Network: Only when active

10 servers ≈ 100-500MB RAM total
🎯 Practical Limits
Performance:

Your machine's RAM/CPU
Network bandwidth for API-heavy servers
VS Code's ability to manage connections

Management:

Configuration complexity
Debugging multiple servers
Startup time (more servers = slower VS Code launch)

🛠️ Best Practices
🔄 Conditional Loading

}
📦 Server Grouping

Development servers (git, filesystem, terminal)
Communication servers (email, slack, discord)
Data servers (databases, APIs)
Cloud servers (AWS, Docker, monitoring)

🚨 Watch Out For

🐌 Too many = slower VS Code startup
🔧 Configuration complexity
🔍 Harder debugging
💸 API rate limits (for cloud services)

💡 Sweet Spot
Most developers run 5-15 servers comfortably. Start small and add as needed!
